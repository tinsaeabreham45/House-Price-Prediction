# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using a manually implemented linear regression model and random Forest Algorithm. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of supervised learning, data preprocessing, and regression analysis without using specialized machine learning libraries.

## Project Overview

House price prediction is a classic regression problem. The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and price per square unit. 

This project is a learning exercise to solidify foundational concepts in machine learning and demonstrate the capability to build models from scratch.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features like area, bedrooms, and price for prediction.
- **Linear Regression Implementation**: Manually implemented linear regression without ML libraries.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model.
- **Visualizations**: Insightful plots to understand data distribution and model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- **Area**: The size of the house in square units.
- **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Price**: The price of the house.

The dataset is stored in CSV format and loaded for processing during the project.

## Results
The model achieves reasonable accuracy on the test set linear model 52% accuracy and on the randomForest 92% this is very good , with visualizations showing the predicted vs. actual prices. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the primary evaluation metric.

## Visualization
Key plots include:
**Data distribution histograms.**
**Predicted vs. actual prices scatter plot.**
